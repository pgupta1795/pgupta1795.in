## Introduction

I started my career as a backend developer mainly working on Java, JSPs and Spring Boot back in 2016, and around 2020 I began my journey on react.js, web development and gradually progressing to other frameworks and technologies including Next.Js and typescript. I have worked on various projects across different industries.
