## Introduction

The survey application empowers administrators to create customized forms. These forms can be distributed to employees or specific user groups. User responses are collected and visually represented through graphical representations. Additionally, the application generates reports based on the responses and sends them via email to the designated users. It streamlines the process of gathering feedback and analyzing data from various stakeholders.
