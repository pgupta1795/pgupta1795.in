## Features

Let's dive into the new features and improvements In PersonAI.

### Chatbot

PersonAI provides chatbots using [Llama2](https://github.com/langchain/llama2) or [Mistral 7b](https://github.com/langchain/mistral7b) modesl to answer queries that the end user asks based on the data that you integrate from different sources.
Data integrated by each user is stored in the database and security is ensured using JWT tokens so that integrated data of one user is not exposed to other users.

### Integrations

#### Confluence Integration

`Confluence` is a popular collaboration tool used by many companies. It provides a centralized place to store and share information. Due to its popularity, it is a good candidate for integration, allowing you to create chatbots that can answer questions from your documentation.
You will need to create a `Confluence` account and generate an API token. You can find the steps to generate the API token [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html).
You will need to provide the confluence space name as well as the API token to the chatbot builder.

#### URL Integration

You can integrate `URLs` to your chatbot. The chatbot will fetch the content from the URL and use it to answer questions.

#### File Integration

You can integrate `files` such as PDFs, Word docs, Code files, Excels, PPTs, etc. to your chatbot. The chatbot will fetch the content from the file and use it to answer questions.

#### Github / Bitbucket Integration

You can integrate your `Github` or `Bitbucket` repositories to your chatbot. The chatbot will fetch the content from the repository and use it to answer questions.
You will need to create a git account in github or bitbucket and generate an API token. You can find the steps to generate the API token [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
You will need to provide the github/ bitbucket repo name along with the API token to the chatbot builder.

## Conclusion

To summarize PersonAI is a full stack RAG based AI application that lets you build chatbots using your data. It is a good candidate for integration with Confluence, JIRA, PDFs, Word docs, URLs, etc.
